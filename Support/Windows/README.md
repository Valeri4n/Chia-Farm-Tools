This might be worth saving as a note for future reference:  
```
1. Open file explorer
2. Navigate to the bladebit folder
3. Right click and select open in terminal
4. Run the plotting commands
```  
```
Two ways to do this:
File Explorer (this is how we did it yesterday)

    Open file explorer
    Navigate to the bladebit_cuda folder
    Run the command


Powershell (this is a different method)

    Open powershell
    Run cd C:\Users\d4848\downloads\bladebit-cuda-v3.1.0-windows-x86-64
    Run the command
```
